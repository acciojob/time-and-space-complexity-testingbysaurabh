    <h1>Time and Space Complexity</h1>

    <p>Time complexity refers to the amount of time an algorithm takes to run as a function of its input size. It helps us analyze how efficient an algorithm is in terms of execution time. Understanding time complexity is crucial for improving the efficiency of algorithms, especially when handling large inputs.</p>

    <p><b>Space Complexity</b> is concerned with the amount of memory an algorithm uses as a function of the size of its input. It evaluates the extra space required in addition to the input data. For example, an algorithm with a space complexity of <i>O(n)</i> means that the amount of memory used grows linearly with the input size.</p>
